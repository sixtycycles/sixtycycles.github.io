I work for UCLA, where I'm the IT Director for the Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences. I'm working to modernize the department's workflows and tech stack, while supporting lots of specialized scientific labs and research groups. 
Generally, I'm curious about how things work and why they break or stop working.


I like learning new things!
Some of the fun things I have learned recently are:

  * More than I ever wanted to know about remodeling an entire house
  * Networking
  * Many things can be waffles if you try hard enough
