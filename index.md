I work for UCLA, where I'm the IT Director for the Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences. I'm working to modernize the department's workflows and tech stack, while supporting lots of specialized scientific labs and research groups. 
Generally, I'm curious about how things work and why they break or stop working.

I like learning new things!
Some of the fun things I have learned recently are:

  * More than I ever wanted to know about remodeling an entire house
  * Networking
  * Many things can be waffles if you try hard enough

I've done a lot of different things for money. I feel like this has made me a better engineer, and problem solver in general. I really am interested in how knowledge can be applied across different domains.
I can work on Diesel engines, and I can replace a cast iron toilet flange; the furnace stopped working and I just looked at it, and was able to tell the fan motor on the exhaust inducer had burned out, and knew how to fix it. 
I think people can benefit from learning to work in really different ways, and in different industries. I worked on a farm for 3 years, and I worked really hard outside all the time. Now I'm working with computers and am extremely inside. 
It's been pretty cool. I'm thankful for the skills I've picked up, and I really like to use them to help out. My wish for my fellow humans is "bathrobe with a cocktail on the beach and no debt, and everyone looks good" energy.
